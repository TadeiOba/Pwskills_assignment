Qn.4

<!--
1.Tag:
- A "tag" is a fundamental building block in HTML, represented by angle brackets (e.g., `<tag>`).
- Tags are used to define HTML elements and give them meaning.
- Tags are typically composed of an opening tag (`<tag>`) and a closing tag (`</tag>`), which surround the content.
- Some HTML tags are self-closing and don't require a closing tag (e.g., `<img>` for images).

2.Element:
- An "element" is formed by a pair of tags (opening and closing) and the content enclosed between them.
- The opening tag defines the start of an element, and the closing tag defines its end.
- Elements can be nested inside other elements to create a hierarchical structure.

Here's an example of an HTML element with tags:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```

In this example:
- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.
- "This is a paragraph element." is the content of the `<p>` element.

Together, the opening and closing tags define the `<p>` element, which is used to create paragraphs of text on a web page.

Qn.5

<!--
 The DOCTYPE declaration typically appears at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> element.
 It is used to ensure that the web browser or parser renders the document in the correct mode and adheres to the specified HTML or XML standard.
